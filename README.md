## üìã Project Description

This project is an **automatic smart parking system** using **ultrasonic sensors**, a **servo gate**, LEDs, and an **LCD display**. It checks if cars are present in parking slots and at the entrance gate:
- If there are **free slots**, the gate opens automatically.
- If the parking is **full**, the gate stays closed.
- An LCD shows each slot‚Äôs status (**Free/Full**) in real-time.
- Green and red LEDs show slot availability for drivers.
